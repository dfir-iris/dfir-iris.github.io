# Python client

`dfir_iris_client` offers a Python interface to communicate with IRIS.  

It relies exclusively on the API, which means output of the methods are the same as specified in the [API reference](https://dfir-iris.github.io/operations/api/#references). 


## Installation
It can be easily with pip : ``pip3 install dfir_iris_client``.  

The source code of the project is available [here](https://github.com/dfir-iris/iris-client).  

## Versions
The Python client version follows the API versions (until the patch level). Meaning for API v1.0.1, one need to install `dfir_iris_client-1.0.1`. 


## Examples
Examples of usage are available [here](https://github.com/dfir-iris/iris-client/tree/master/examples).
