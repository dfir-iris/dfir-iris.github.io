# Introduction

!!! tip "*New types of modules are introduced in IRIS v1.4.0*"

IRIS can be extended with modules. They can be split in two types:   

- Pipeline modules : Allow upload and process of evidences through modular pipelines (eg: EVTX parsing and injection into a database or data visualiser)
- Processor modules : Allow processing of IRIS data upon predefined actions / hooks. (eg: be notified when a new IOC is created and get VT/MISP insights for it).

Modules (or DIM - DFIR-IRIS Modules) are actually Python packages which must be installed in the Python environment of iris-webapp and the worker (see Quick Start).
Once installed in the Python environment, modules can be managed in ``Advanced`` > ``Modules``.
