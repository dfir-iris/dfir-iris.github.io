Reports
========
Iris has the ability to generate reports based on the data of an investigation.    
The reports templates can be managed in ``Advanced`` > ``Templates``.

  This section is only available for users with the Admin role.

Structure of templates
----------------------
Reports templates are made of tags, which are then processed and filed by the template engine of Iris. 
The templates can have any forms as soon as they respect the tags. An example of report is available in the source code of Iris, ``source > app > templates > docx_reports``.

The following tags are available. None are mandatory. If a tag is mistyped, the generation step will produce an error message. 

.. admonition::  Hint

  Standard objects are accessible with ``{{ objectname }}``.
  List objects can be looped:
